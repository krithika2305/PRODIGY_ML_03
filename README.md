# Prodigy Info Tech - Machine Learning Internship Task 03  
## Implement a SVM to classify Images of Cats and Dogs  

This project is a simple image classifier built with **Tkinter GUI** that predicts whether an uploaded image is a **cat** or a **dog**  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **GUI Library**: Tkinter
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn (SVM, PCA, StandardScaler)
- **Feature Extraction**: HOG (from scikit-image)
- **Image Handling**: Pillow (PIL)

## 📦 Dataset  
👉 [Dogs vs. Cats - Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data)  
The project uses the **Dogs vs Cats** dataset from Kaggle:  

- 25,000 labeled images (12,500 cats, 12,500 dogs)
- Used only 2000 images per class for training due to local compute limitations
- Images were resized to 128×128 grayscale for feature consistency

## 📈 Model Performance  

| Metric      | Score   |  
|-------------|---------|  
| Accuracy    | 85–90%  |  
| Classes     | Cat (0), Dog (1) |  
| Input Size  | 128 x 128 grayscale |  
| Feature Size| 8100 (HOG) ➝ PCA ➝ SVM |  

✅ Performance may vary based on dataset size and image quality.
